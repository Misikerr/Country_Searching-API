# Country Searching API 🌍

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate web APIs into a website. It is a simple web application that allows users to search for information about countries by name. The site fetches data from a public country information API and displays details such as the country's name, region, population, language, and currency.

## What I Learned 🚀
Through building this project, I have gained practical experience in:
- 🌐 Integrating web APIs with a website using JavaScript
- 🔄 Fetching and handling data from external sources
- 🖥️ Dynamically updating the DOM based on API responses
- 👨‍💻 Creating a user-friendly interface for searching and displaying country information

## Features ✨
- **🔎 Search by Country Name:** Enter the name of a country to retrieve and display its details.
- **🧹 Clear Results:** Easily clear the search results to start a new search.
- **📱 Responsive Design:** The site is styled for usability and works well on different devices.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. The user enters a country name in the input field and clicks the "Search" button.
2. The site sends a request to a public country API (such as [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/)).
3. The response is processed and the relevant country information is displayed on the page.
4. The "Clear" button allows users to reset the search and results.
