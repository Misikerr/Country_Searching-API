# Country Searching API

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate web APIs into a website. It is a simple web application that allows users to search for information about countries by name. The site fetches data from a public country information API and displays details such as the country's name, region, population, language, and currency.

## What I Learned
Through building this project, I have gained practical experience in:
- Integrating web APIs with a website using JavaScript
- Fetching and handling data from external sources
- Dynamically updating the DOM based on API responses
- Creating a user-friendly interface for searching and displaying country information

## Features
- **Search by Country Name:** Enter the name of a country to retrieve and display its details.
- **Clear Results:** Easily clear the search results to start a new search.
- **Responsive Design:** The site is styled for usability and works well on different devices.

## How It Works
1. The user enters a country name in the input field and clicks the "Search" button.
2. The site sends a request to a public country API (such as [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/)).
3. The response is processed and the relevant country information is displayed on the page.
4. The "Clear" button allows users to reset the search and results.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Fetch API)
- Public Country Data API

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter a country name and click "Search" to see the results.

## Credits
